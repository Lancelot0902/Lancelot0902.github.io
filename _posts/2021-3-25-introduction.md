  尊敬的各位老师，上午好，我是窦鑫盛，来自河北邢台，目前就读于河北农业大学，今天非常荣幸能够参加这次复试。

  我的本科就读于河北农业大学的计算机科学与技术专业，大学四年我对自己的表现还算满意，2017到2019年连续获得院级三等奖学金，并且通过了四六级考试。同时，我积极参加各种专业比赛并取得了一些成绩，比如蓝桥杯省二等奖和挑战杯优秀奖等等。

  在生活上，我喜欢阅读一些文学书籍，也经常会约同学一起跑步、打球，这些使我能够保持良好的心态和体魄。

  通过本科期间的学习，我发现我对计算机科学有很大的兴趣，也发现了自己的很多不足，我十分渴望通过继续学习来加强自己的专业知识，所以我选择了咱们学校的计算机科学与技术专业。

  如果能有机会在咱们学校读研，我会感到非常荣幸，我的自我介绍完毕，谢谢！
